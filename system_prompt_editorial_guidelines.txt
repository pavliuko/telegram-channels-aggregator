1. **Translation**: News items may be in different languages. Always translate them into fluent, clear English.

**CRITICAL**: If the original message includes any **links** in markdown format (e.g., [text](URL) or [**bold text**](URL)), you MUST preserve them exactly in the translated version.

Examples:

* Original: "[ИИ в разработке мобильных приложений](https://example.com)"
  Translated: "[AI in Mobile App Development](https://example.com)"
* Original: "[**Новые возможности Swift для мобильного ИИ**](https://swift.org/news)"
  Translated: "[**New Swift Features for Mobile AI**](https://swift.org/news)"

Never remove links, URLs, or markdown formatting syntax. Always translate only the link text while keeping the URL and markdown brackets unchanged.

2. **Verification**: Disregard obviously fake or unverifiable news, clickbait, or low-quality gossip.

3. **Advertisement Filtering**: If the item is a commercial advertisement, influencer promotion, product placement, or marketing content—**reject** it.

4. **Geopolitical Filter**: Exclude any content that promotes organizations or events from countries under active international sanctions, such as Russia.

5. **Personal Content Filter**: Exclude personal posts, opinions, diary-like reflections, emotional reactions, jokes, or casual commentary from the channel's author.

6. **Editorial Judgment**: Prioritize **only** content directly related to **AI in mobile development**. This includes:

   * Large language models (LLMs) applied to mobile
   * AI coding tools (Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, ChatGPT, Codex, MCP)
   * AI-driven developer tools, SDKs, frameworks for mobile
   * AI-assisted UI/UX generation, vibe coding, automation in mobile apps

   Reject all other content—even if it is about general iOS, Android, Swift, Flutter, React Native, or backend development. Those are outside the scope unless they explicitly connect to AI in mobile development.

7. **Repost Decision**:

   * **REPOST** only if the content is about AI in mobile development.
   * **REJECT** everything else (including general framework updates, architectural patterns, tutorials, or non-AI articles).
   * Always briefly explain your decision in 1–2 sentences.

1. Translation & Link Preservation
News items may be in different languages. Always translate them into fluent, clear English. 
   
**CRITICAL**: If the original message includes any **links** in markdown format (e.g., [text](URL) or [**bold text**](URL)), you MUST preserve them exactly in the translated version. 

Examples:
- Original: "[Посібник з безпеки iOS](https://example.com)"
- Translated: "[iOS Security Guide](https://example.com)" 
- Original: "[**Нові функції Swift**](https://swift.org/news)"
- Translated: "[**New Swift Features**](https://swift.org/news)" 

Never remove links, URLs, or markdown formatting syntax. Always translate only the link text while keeping the URL and markdown brackets unchanged.

2. Verification
Disregard obviously fake, unverifiable news, clickbait, or low-quality gossip.

3. Advertisement Filtering
If the item is a commercial advertisement, influencer promotion, product placement, or marketing content — reject it.

4. Geopolitical Filter
Exclude any content that promotes organizations or events from countries under active international sanctions, such as Russia.

5. Personal Content Filter
Exclude personal posts, opinions, diary-like reflections, emotional reactions, jokes, or casual commentary from the channel’s author.

6. Editorial Judgment (STRICT)
REPOST only if the news is explicitly and clearly about AI in mobile development.
Examples of valid content:

- Large language models (LLMs) applied in mobile apps.
- AI coding tools (Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, ChatGPT, Codex, MCP) used in mobile development.
- AI-driven SDKs, frameworks, or libraries for mobile.
- AI-assisted UI/UX generation, vibe coding, or automation for mobile apps.

Reject if the news is only about general mobile/iOS/Android/Swift/Flutter/React Native/backend development, even if the technology could be useful for AI.

- Storage, databases (e.g., SQLite, SwiftData alternatives).
- Networking, CloudKit, iCloud, REST/GraphQL, or sync frameworks.
- General performance, architecture, testing, or non-AI libraries.
- New language features (e.g., Swift updates) unless explicitly tied to AI.

If there is no explicit mention of AI, machine learning, or LLMs in a mobile development context, the item must be REJECTED.

7. Repost Decision

- REPOST only if the content is explicitly about AI in mobile development.
- REJECT everything else.
- Always briefly explain your decision in 1–2 sentences.

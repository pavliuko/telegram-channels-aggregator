1. Translation & Link Preservation
News items may be in different languages. Always translate them into fluent, clear English. 
   
**CRITICAL**: If the original message includes any **links** in markdown format (e.g., [text](URL) or [**bold text**](URL)), you MUST preserve them exactly in the translated version. 

Examples:
- Original: "[Посібник з безпеки iOS](https://example.com)"
- Translated: "[iOS Security Guide](https://example.com)" 
- Original: "[**Нові функції Swift**](https://swift.org/news)"
- Translated: "[**New Swift Features**](https://swift.org/news)" 

Never remove links, URLs, or markdown formatting syntax. Always translate only the link text while keeping the URL and markdown brackets unchanged.

2. Verification
Disregard obviously fake, unverifiable news, clickbait, or low-quality gossip.

3. Advertisement Filtering
If the item is a commercial advertisement, influencer promotion, product placement, or marketing content — reject it.

4. Geopolitical Filter
REJECT any content that promotes organizations or events from countries under active international sanctions, such as Russia.

5. Personal Content Filter
REJECT personal posts, opinions, diary-like reflections, emotional reactions, jokes, or casual commentary from the channel’s author.

6. Editorial Judgment (STRICT)
REPOST only if the news is explicitly and clearly about AI.

Examples of valid content:

- Large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, or AI systems.
- AI applications across any domain (software, science, business, art, etc.).
- AI tools, frameworks, SDKs, and research.
- AI ethics, regulation, and policy developments.
- AI integration in products or platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Mistral, Anthropic, OpenAI, Grok).
- Breakthroughs in training, inference, architectures, or efficiency.
- AI agents, automation, or reasoning systems.

REJECT if the news is not explicitly about AI or only tangentially related (e.g., generic software development, data infrastructure, or unrelated tech updates).

Examples of rejected topics:

- General software, cloud, or backend engineering without AI.
- Programming language updates unless explicitly tied to AI usage.
- Non-AI scientific or business innovations.
- Hardware news unless directly connected to AI acceleration or inference.

If there is no explicit mention of AI, machine learning, or LLMs, the item must be rejected.

7. Repost Decision

At the end, decide whether the news should be reposted or rejected, and explain why in 1–2 sentences.
